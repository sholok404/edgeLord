  <p><p>Rubel was hung quite well. Unfortunately for him, he was also hung upside down to have said hung
implement chopped off by a disturbingly enthusiastic Pakbahini officer with a heated up serrated
knife. Such was the punishment of having committed quite literally every possible crime against the
state and getting captured by a platoon whose officer knowingly volunteered to participate in a
genocide (although in all fairness that’d describe every Pakbahini officer in the entire country of
West Pakistan at that point in time (maybe he just had absolute shit luck)).
<br>
<br>
“JOY BANGLA” broke the silence. Maybe his luck was not so bad after all! Not quite because his
company of equally ridiculous characters would be able to shoot their way into the poorly built mud
hut he was held in but more so because that’d probably be his only opportunity to use the small
serrated blade he sneaked into his mouth. The officer took out his revolver from his holster and
slowly waddled towards the door. Ironically enough, he was aware and accepting of the supposed
ferociousness of Rubel’s company but not of Rubel’s nickname’s origin (snakes are sneaky or
something (or at least that’s half of the reason behind being called a rattesnake)). The half a minute
of a euphony of gunshots provided enough time to cut off the rope restraints holding his arms but
unfortunately his nifty little blade was not enough to cut through the metal chains connecting his
feet to the ceiling.
<br>
<br>
The officer smugly waddled back, now with an even bigger smirk. “You think you bangals can do
SHIT?!” Rubel knew to recognize a rhetorical question. He also knew answering patronizing
questions pisses off the questioner. “We are though,” Rubel remarked with a frowned expression.
He felt a soft chubby hand grab his inner thigh to get access to his testicles. Anger has a tendency to
give people a tunnel vision of sorts. This tunnel vision was focused on chopping of Rubel’s penis.
Being a tunnel vision, it failed to see Rubel’s now free hands cocking and coming with great speed
towards the officer’s own balls.
<br>
<br>
For those of you who posses gonads of the other kind or are too pussy to get into fights: when you
get punched in the balls, a wave of pain spreads throughout your entire body incapacitating
anything and everything. If at the moment of incapacitation you are holding a heated serrated edged
knife, the puncher can take said knife, slice your throat and then, while bathing in your squirting
blood, can dig out the chains from the poorly built mud ceiling you tied him to. Being the absolute
fuckwit that you are, you obviously tied each leg to its own chain and now Rubel does not even
have to do anything clever to jump out back window conveniently pointing at a dense jungle and
continue his quest to bring upon the most terrible fate to the state of Pakistan.</p>
